"""
build_invoice — PURE function that turns inputs into an Invoice dataclass.

⚠️ NO database calls here. No `datetime.now()`. No PDF. Just math.

The order is FIXED:
    1. base       = strategy.calculate(usage)
    2. discount   = discount.apply(base) if discount else 0
    3. taxable    = base - discount
    4. tax        = tax_calc.apply(taxable)
    5. total      = taxable + tax.total
